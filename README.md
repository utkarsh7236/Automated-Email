# Automated-Email
Automated Email in Python
This is my very first project! Feel free to have a look and comment. 
The project uses python code to send an automated email over a list of names. 
I iterrated over each list specializing the email to the specific name of the person. 
Change your smtp if you want to use this for yourself, and you are not using gmail. 
Add the list of emails in emails.txt and your email password in password.txt! 

Thank you!
